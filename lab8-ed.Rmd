```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
salmon <- read_csv("salmon_fresh.csv") %>% 
  select(year, salmon_fresh)

```

Exploration of the data :

```{r}

salmon_scatter <- ggplot(salmon, aes(x=year, y=salmon_fresh)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic()

salmon_scatter

#overall there does seem to be a linear relationship between the year and the amount of salmon imported (lbs), but there seems to be two clusters of data (6 points total, that dont fit the model)

```
